Agile isn’t one-size-fits-all. Various Agile frameworks cater to different team structures and project demands. Below is an overview of some common approaches:

| **Methodology**                               | **Key Characteristics**                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scrum**                                     | Defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), sprint cycles, and regular retrospectives. |
| **Kanban**                                    | A visual workflow management system emphasizing continuous delivery while limiting work in progress.      |
| **Lean**                                      | Focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing efficiency, delivering value quickly.                         |
| **Extreme Programming (XP)**                  | Emphasizes technical excellence through practices such as test-driven development and pair programming.   |
| **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)**          | Centers on building features in short iterations, ideal for managing large-scale projects incrementally.  |
| **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)** | A structured Agile framework that follows defined phases and governance.                                  |
| **Crystal**                                   | Adapts to team size and project complexity, with an emphasis on open communication.                       |

Each methodology offers a unique perspective. Choose one that best aligns with your team’s culture, project needs, and workflow preferences.
