# Cone of Uncertainty

The Cone of Uncertainty highlights that during a project, our understanding of the final product improves over time - while the cost of making changes also increases.

## Breakdown

- **Early Stages:**  
  At the start of a project, the vision is vague, and changes are relatively low-cost because details arenâ€™t yet fully defined.

- **Later Stages:**  
  As the project progresses, clarity increases, but making changes becomes significantly more expensive.

- **Balancing Act:**  
  The Agile approach strives to balance early decision-making with enough flexibility to accommodate new insights as they emerge.

This underscores the importance of feedback loops and iterative development. Each decision should align with evolving needs while mitigating the risk of costly changes later on.
