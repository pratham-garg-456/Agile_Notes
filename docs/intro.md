# Welcome to Agile Notes

> _The way we do things becomes a part of our reality. If we believe that our current process is the only "right" way, we limit our ability to adapt and innovate. Embracing the Agile mindset means questioning established practices and welcoming continuous evolution._

These notes record what I've learned about Agile so far, and they have been created for personal use. Feel free to explore them, and if you find any mistakes or have suggestions, please email me at prathamgarg456+notes@gmail.com.
