# Combatting Groupthink in Agile Teams

Groupthink occurs when the desire for consensus overrides realistic assessment and suppresses individual creativity. In Agile teams, this can hinder innovation and lead to poor decision-making.

## Why Groupthink is Problematic

- **Reduced Innovation:**  
  Uncritical agreement can prevent the exploration of fresh, innovative solutions.

## Strategies to Combat Groupthink

- **Encourage Dissent:**  
  Regularly invite different opinions and designate a “devil’s advocate” role to challenge prevailing ideas.

- **Rotate Leadership:**  
  Rotating leadership roles can disrupt dominant perspectives and encourage diverse viewpoints.

- **Structured Retrospectives:**  
  Use devoted sessions to gather honest feedback, ensuring every voice is heard.

- **Foster Psychological Safety:**  
  Create an environment where team members feel secure sharing dissenting opinions without fear of repercussions.
