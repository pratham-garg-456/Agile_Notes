# Agile Teams

Agile teams work on the highest value items first, focusing on delivering customer value. This is different from other software development practices that prioritize technically challenging or time-consuming tasks.

### Key Concepts

- **Product Owner Role:** A representative who ranks all product functions and features by customer value.
- **Scrum Collaboration:** In Scrum, all team members work together simultaneously to complete a small set of tasks, moving the product closer to the goal without multitasking.

### The Penny Game

If work is completed by only one person, it creates handoffs and backups. Agile emphasizes collaboration to avoid such inefficiencies.
