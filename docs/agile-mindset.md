# Agile Mindset

Agile is a different way to think about working. A true Agile team should be able to ask tough questions about the way they work and be open to continuous improvement. Agile is not just an updated set of project management tools; it requires a shift in thinking.

When adopting Agile practices, focus on the reasoning behind them rather than just mastering the practices. For example, instead of simply adhering to two-week sprints, think about why shorter sprints improve team agility.

### Key Insights

- Simply using Agile artifacts (like a product backlog) doesn’t mean you’re being Agile. Agile requires a cultural shift emphasizing collaboration, iterative development, and responsiveness to change.
- The backlog should evolve based on real-time insights and feedback, not from a static, handed-over document.
