# Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto outlines the core values and principles of Agile methodologies.

## Values

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:** Prioritizing personal communication and teamwork rather than rigid systems.
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation:** Focusing on delivering functional software instead of overwhelming paperwork.
